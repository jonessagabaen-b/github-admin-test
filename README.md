# Test Repository
This is a test environment for testing user capabilities in this GitHub repository.

## Purpose
An example need for this environment is that there are repos that I do not have admin permissions.  We want to introduce GitHub PR templates where the user must fill-in required information or that data is auto-filled for us.  We can use this repo with admin permissions to see what we're able to get away with.
